            <h2>Projects to Improve Your Design Skills</h2>

            <h3>Practice Makes Perfect</h3>

            <p>When it comes to becoming a better designer, practice is key. It doesn't happen overnight. Start with small projects you think you can handle and work your way up, don't try to tackle all 10 projects in one day! Practice makes perfect, but it also helps to have tools and tips from seasoned designers.</p>

            <h3>Design Your Personal Website</h3>

            <p>One of the best ways to practice your design skills for a practical use is to develop a personal website. Personal websites can be as a creative or straightforward as you want them to be. The process of making one will help you think about how you want to represent yourself. And, best of all, you'll end up with a professional website to link to for networking and more.</p>

            <h3>Local business Website Homepage</h3>

            <p>If you're an aspiring web designer or want to take a leap and test the limits of your skills, try designing a website for a local business. Local businesses don't often tons of pages on their site. Instead, many just need a central homepage with basic information like hours, contact information, etc.</p>
